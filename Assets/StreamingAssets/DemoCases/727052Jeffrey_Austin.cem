25|727052Jeffrey_Austin|CTI Staff|Jeffrey|Austin|727052|Beginner|Dr. Jeffrey Austin is a 30 year old medical intensivist who has been working in the ICU for 2 years since completing a 5 year combined residency in Emergency Medicine and Internal Medicine followed by a one year fellowship in Critical Care Medicine. He recently married Monica, his girlfriend of 8 years and started renovating a house. They planned on starting a family soon until when Jeffreyâ€™s work became very intense due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was deeply affected recently when someone his own age and in similar life circumstances died of the virus. He wants to talk to a peer because, even though he went through some grief counseling that day, it is still bothering him a couple of weeks later.  |Support for physician distressed from working in COVID-19 critical care|Psychiatry|1596655967|MD/DO|Early Access|0|1|0|https://lift.clinicalencounters.com/ce-activity/physician-peer-support/ce-page/peer-support/|austin
