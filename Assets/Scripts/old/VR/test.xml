    <Text>Hello, Ms. Lee. Good to see you again. How is medical school?</Text>
    <Text>It's stressful, but rewarding.</Text>
    <Text>I understand that. And I see you're here for headaches.</Text>
    <Text>Yes. I think it's tension headaches, but want to make sure it's not something more serious. [Action: worry look as she says the latter few words]</Text>

    <Title>How would you start the History interview?</Title>
    <Option name ="Ask open ended question about headaches">
      <Text>Please tell me more about your headaches.</Text>
      <Text>I get them after a day of classes, several times a week. My forehead and temples ache on both sides. My neck is tight and aches, too. [ACTION: Tilt and turn head a little] It can last for hours.</Text>
      <Text>Sounds rough. How bad are they, on a scale of 1 to 10? [ACTION: If provider is shown, a look of empathy]</Text>
      <Text>They're a 6 or 7. Ibuprofen usually takes care of it. Sometimes, I need an acetaminophen, too. I just hope it's not something serious, like a brain tumor. {ACTION: A little worry again]</Text>
      <Text>Let's see if we can put your mind at ease. I have a few more questions first. [ACTION: Slight, reassuring smile] Any headaches in your family?</Text>
      <Text>No, just occasional tension headaches.</Text>
      <Text>What leads you to think your headaches are more serious than tension headaches?</Text>
      <Text>Nothing, really. It's just that when you're a medical student and you study about cancer and weird diseases, you start to wonder if you have them.</Text>
      <Text>[Laughing] Yes, I remember that! But you think it's probably tension headaches. Why is that?</Text>
      <Text>They're worse when I'm stressed. I feel like I have to remember everything in medicine, because people's lives will be in my hands. So, I work hard all the time to keep up! I knew it would be stressful, but not as much as this. </Text>
      <Text>Do you do anything to manage the stress?</Text>
      <Text>I usually unwind at night with some wine.</Text>
    </Option>
    <Option name ="Ask about her alcohol use">
      <Text>So, you said in your intake information that you are you drinking alcohol. How much are you drinking?</Text>
      <Text>Um, some. [ACTION: Break eye contact and look down] I've been pretty stressed.</Text>
      <Text>How often do you drink?</Text>
      <Text>A few nights a week. It's no big deal. [She pauses.] So, can you make sure these are just tension headaches? I have more of them now, so I just want to make sure it's not a brain tumor. . [ACTION: Worried look] </Text>
      <Text>I'll do my best to help put your mind at ease.</Text>
